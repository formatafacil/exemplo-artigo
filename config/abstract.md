---

In their career at college graduation, students seek to construct an identity in
academic settings, which involves engaging in specific literacy practices and literacy
events. Literacy events in academic settings include the production of prestigious genres
such as the research article. In this paper, we analyze, under the light of Cultural Studies,
New Literacy Studies, and Rhetorical Genre Studies, the production of scientific articles by
undergraduates in Language as a part of the process of studentsâ€™ integration in literacy
practices and literacy events in academy. We analyzed five articles written by students,
focusing on aspects of intertextuality, taken as evidence of attempts at building the literate
identity of students in academic settings through the production of the research article in
dialogue with already recognized writers. Results indicate that students seek to identify
their production with authors through strategies such as direct quoting and other forms of
use of their texts.
